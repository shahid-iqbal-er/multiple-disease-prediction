## 🌟 Introduction

This project was developed as part of an academic effort to explore how classical supervised machine learning models behave on real-world healthcare datasets. The primary goal was not only to achieve high predictive accuracy, but also to understand model behavior, data limitations, and generalization challenges when working with noisy and imperfect clinical data.

The system integrates multiple disease-specific machine learning models into a single Flask-based web application, allowing structured experimentation and comparison across datasets related to Heart Disease, Liver Disease, Chronic Kidney Disease, and Breast Cancer. The project emphasizes reproducibility, comparative evaluation, and practical constraints commonly encountered in applied healthcare machine learning.

## 🧠 Supported Diseases & Best Models

The project currently supports predictions for the following diseases, leveraging carefully selected and optimized Machine Learning models:

| Disease                 | Best Model          | Test Accuracy | Notes                                  |
| :---------------------- | :------------------ | :------------ | :------------------------------------- |
| Heart Disease           | Logistic Regression | ~88.52%       | Strong generalization, low overfitting |
| Liver Disease           | Logistic Regression | ~73.50%       | Most stable across splits              |
| Chronic Kidney Disease  | Decision Tree       | ~100%         | Dataset is highly separable            |
| Breast Cancer           | Random Forest       | ~97.37%       | Best precision & F1 score              |

Each selected model is trained on its respective full dataset and saved as a serialized `.pkl` file. The Flask application efficiently loads these models for real-time predictions.

## 📊 ML Development Workflow

Each disease prediction model follows a comprehensive Machine Learning development workflow, meticulously documented in individual Jupyter notebooks:

1.  **Load Dataset**: Ingestion of raw, publicly available datasets.
2.  **Handle Missing Values**: Implementation of strategies for data imputation or removal.
3.  **Clean & Preprocess Features**: Essential steps including feature scaling, encoding, and transformation.
4.  **Define Multiple Candidate Models**: Exploration and configuration of various ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost).
5.  **Train Models & Compute Metrics**: Training on preprocessed data and rigorous calculation of performance metrics:
    *   Accuracy
    *   Precision
    *   Recall
    *   F1 Score
6.  **Visualize Performance**: Generation of insightful visualizations:
    *   Confusion Matrices for error analysis.
    *   ROC Curves and AUC scores for model discrimination.
    *   Comparison of train vs. test metrics to assess overfitting/underfitting tendencies.
7.  **Select the Best Model**: Identification of the optimal model based on evaluated metrics, stability, and generalization ability.
8.  **Save Model**: Serialization of the chosen model to a `.pkl` file for seamless deployment within the web application.

## ⚠️ Data Challenges & Limitations

This project intentionally worked with publicly available healthcare datasets to reflect real-world constraints rather than idealized experimental conditions.

Several limitations were observed during experimentation:

- **Data scarcity and noise**: Some datasets, particularly the Indian Liver Patient Dataset, contained missing values, noisy measurements, and overlapping feature distributions, which limited model separability.
- **Class imbalance**: Certain disease classes were underrepresented, affecting recall and stability across train–test splits.
- **Lower liver disease performance**: Liver disease prediction achieved approximately **73.5% accuracy**, significantly lower than other tasks, largely due to weak feature separability and noise amplification during preprocessing.
- **Lack of longitudinal features**: All datasets were tabular and static, without temporal or follow-up information, restricting modeling of disease progression.
- **Limited external validation**: Models were evaluated on dataset-specific splits and not tested across multiple populations, which may affect generalizability.

These challenges reinforced the importance of robust preprocessing, careful metric selection beyond accuracy, and the need for explainable and uncertainty-aware models in healthcare applications.

Once your virtual environment is active, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Application

With all dependencies installed, you can now run the Flask application:

```bash
python App/app.py
```

The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

## 💡 Usage

1.  **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2.  **Select a Disease**: From the home page, choose the disease you wish to predict (Heart, Liver, Kidney, or Cancer).
3.  **Input Parameters**: You will be directed to a dedicated form for the selected disease. Enter the required clinical parameters into the input fields. Ensure to provide valid numerical inputs as specified.
4.  **Get Prediction**: Click the "Predict" button. The system will process your inputs using the pre-trained Machine Learning model.
5.  **View Results**: The prediction result will be displayed, indicating whether the individual is at "Low Risk" (Green) or "High Risk" (Red) for the selected disease, along with a probability score if available.

## 💡 Suggestions for Improvement

To further enhance this project, consider the following actionable tips:

1.  **Implement User Authentication & Profiles**: Add user registration and login functionality to allow users to save their prediction history, manage profiles, and potentially track changes over time.
2.  **Add a Database for Predictions**: Integrate a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) to persistently store user inputs and prediction results. This would enable the "Result History" feature currently marked as a placeholder and facilitate further analysis.
3.  **Improve Model Explainability (XAI)**: Incorporate techniques like SHAP or LIME to provide insights into *why* a particular prediction was made. This enhances trust and understanding, especially in a health context.
4.  **Containerization with Docker**: Provide a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to enable easy and consistent deployment across different environments, simplifying setup for new contributors or users.
5.  **Expand Disease Prediction Scope**: Research and integrate models for additional common diseases (e.g., Diabetes, Parkinson's Disease) to broaden the utility of the platform.
