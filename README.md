📌 Multiple Disease Prediction System (ML + Flask Web App)

Predict Heart Disease, Liver Disease, Kidney Disease, and Breast Cancer using trained Machine Learning models and a Flask-based web interface.

🚀 Overview

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning and Web Application system that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases based on clinical input features.

It includes:

Complete model training pipelines in Jupyter notebooks

Best model selection for each disease

A Flask web application for user interaction

A clean, responsive UI with symptom descriptions and model performance

Real-time ML predictions using .pkl models

## Supported Diseases & Best Models

| Disease               | Best Model           | Test Accuracy | Notes                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Heart Disease         | Logistic Regression  | ~88.52%       | Strong generalization, low overfitting |
| Liver Disease         | Logistic Regression  | ~73.50%       | Most stable across splits              |
| Chronic Kidney Disease| Decision Tree        | ~100%         | Dataset is very separable              |
| Breast Cancer         | Random Forest        | ~97.37%       | Best precision & F1                    |

Each best-performing model is trained on full data and saved as `<disease>_best_model.pkl`, which the Flask app loads for prediction.
