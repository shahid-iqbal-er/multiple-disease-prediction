## 🧠 Supported Diseases & Best Models

The project currently supports predictions for the following diseases, utilizing carefully selected and optimized Machine Learning models:

| Disease                 | Best Model          | Test Accuracy | Notes                                  |
| :---------------------- | :------------------ | :------------ | :------------------------------------- |
| Heart Disease           | Logistic Regression | ~88.52%       | Strong generalization, low overfitting |
| Liver Disease           | Logistic Regression | ~73.50%       | Most stable across splits              |

## 🚀 Getting Started (Installation)

Follow these steps to set up and run the Multiple Disease Prediction System locally.

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiple-disease-prediction.git
cd multiple-disease-prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**On Windows:**

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install all required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Application

Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the Flask application:

```bash
python App/app.py
```

The application will typically be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

## 💡 Usage

1.  **Navigate to the Home Page**: Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2.  **Select a Disease**: From the navigation menu or the home page, choose the disease you wish to predict (Heart Disease, Liver Disease, Chronic Kidney Disease, or Breast Cancer).
3.  **Enter Parameters**: Fill in the required clinical parameters in the dedicated form. Ensure you provide valid inputs as guided by the form labels.
4.  **Get Prediction**: Click the "Predict" button. The application will process your inputs using the pre-trained ML model and display the prediction result (e.g., "You are Healthy" or "You are at Risk").
5.  **Explore Other Predictions**: You can navigate back to the home page or select another disease from the menu to perform additional predictions.

## 💡 Suggestions for Improvement

To further enhance this project and its utility, consider the following actionable tips:

1.  **Implement User Authentication & Result History**: Introduce user accounts to store prediction history, allowing users to track their results over time and retrieve past predictions. This would require integrating a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) and user management (e.g., Flask-Login).
2.  **Add Input Validation & Error Handling**: Enhance the web application with robust client-side and server-side input validation to provide immediate feedback to users for incorrect or out-of-range inputs, and handle potential errors gracefully.
3.  **Expand Model Interpretability**: Integrate tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to provide insights into *why* a particular prediction was made, increasing trust and understanding of the ML models.
4.  **Develop a CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to automate testing, building, and deployment of the application, ensuring code quality and faster releases.
5.  **Containerize with Docker**: Create a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to containerize the application. This would simplify deployment, ensure consistent environments, and make the project easier to run across different systems.
